### Implementation of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752) from first principles

This project was created as the final project for the Fall '22 semester at IU for the subject Deep Learning Systems. 

Please find the report for the project [here](_), the [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bhargavsdesai/laion_improved_aesthetics_6.5plus_with_images) (created from a subset of the original LAION set) for the project here, and a folder with generated images here. 


#### **Notebooks**

The code used for creating the dataset linked above, can be found and run [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/bhargavdesai98/laion-dataset-creation)

A notebook that can be run (end to end) to train your own diffusion model from scratch can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/bhargavdesai98/stable-diffusion-on-laion). This notebook is hosted and made public on Kaggle that offers free GPUs for research and education!
